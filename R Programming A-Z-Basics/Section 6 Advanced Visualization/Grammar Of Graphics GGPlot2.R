 #Charls minar made a map for france vs moscou in a 2d pic it wasnt grammer of graphics tho but he started the concept of layerting

#Layers of a chart :
1.Data #necessary - we cant see them mostly somewhere in background
2.Aesthetics #necessary - we cant see them mapping of data to chart 
3.Geometries #necessary - bars , circles , square
4.Stats #additional data - distribution making a group etc or making a count of same data
5.Facets #additional data - if we had multiple charts for same thing lets say over years
6.Coordinates  #additional data - x axis and y axis also zoom in and out
7.Theme  #additional data - everything else to please eyes so title legends ka size title ka size etc : non data ink bhi bolte h
