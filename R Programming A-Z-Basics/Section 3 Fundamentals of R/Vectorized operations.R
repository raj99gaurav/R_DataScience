#Vectorized operations

#to add two vectors in R we can simply add vectors using + sign without using loops
#as everything is vectors so we can perform all type of operastions using boolean > < etc 

#--- Recyling of vector ---
what happens if we add small vector with big vector
condition is small vector should be multiple of large vector in
this case R will replicate small vector then add the two
even it is not true the recyling will happen but we will get a warning as well


#vectors can be arguments with in functions

also vectors can be returned from the functions
